# Overview

Groups similar clonotypes into clusters based on their sequences. It utilizes the MMseqs2 (`easy-cluster` command) software for fast and sensitive sequence searching and clustering, grouping sequences that meet a specified identity threshold. The results are visualized using bubble plot for easy interpretation.

MMseqs2 is developed by the SÃ¶ding lab and Steinegger group. For more information, please see: [https://github.com/soedinglab/MMseqs2](https://github.com/soedinglab/MMseqs2) and cite the following publication if used in your research:
